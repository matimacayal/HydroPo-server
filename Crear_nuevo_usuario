If you're here then you either just installed IntroÂ® or installed it 
and now you want to add gates. For the second case jump to step #3, 
if not follow these ones:

1. Enter your number so we can send you a message with a verification code
2. Wait for the message to arrive so we can catch your code

    If the sms verification service is unavailable or you want to do it manually:
    2.1.1  Go to .logindata/ in the cgi-bin/ directory.
    2.1.2  There you will find a file named 'phoneNumberYouEntered.incomplete'.
    2.1.3  Inside information about date, your country, your phone and the CODE
           has been saved.
    2.1.4  Press 'enter code manually' in your app and enter your code manually
    2.2.5  Pass to the next phase

3. A file in .logindata/ in the cgi-bin/ directory named by the phone you 
   entered has been created, look for it.
4. Your id (phone number) and token generated had been saved at the end of the file.
5. With these information we now go to the 'gates_data' file in cgi-bin/. Here all
   users-gates information is stored. Almost surely theres data from others users
   so you can see the data structure in the form of a Json - if you're not 
   familiarized with json please take a look of it in the web -. The data of a 
   single user has the next format(?):
   
...
    ...
    ],

    "98899889":
    [
	    {"token":"FLMEXw4"},
	    {"gates":
		    [
		    {"name":"Olimpo"          , "id":"gudf6hy5FT", "phone":"99999999", "latitude":-33.387644, "longitude":-70.617558, "far_gate":"LOCKED", "distance":8000.0, "geofence":"false", "radius":0.0},

		    {"name":"Moneda"          , "id":"gu876hy5FT", "phone":"99999999", "latitude":-33.387796, "longitude":-70.616029, "far_gate":"AERT"  , "distance":8000.0, "geofence":"false", "radius":0.0},

		    {"name":"Antartida"       , "id":"gUDf6yh5FT", "phone":"99999999", "latitude":-33.421727, "longitude":-70.574167, "far_gate":"ALERT" , "distance":5000.0, "geofence":"false", "radius":0.0},
		    {"name":"El_Dorado"       , "id":"gUdF6yh5FT", "phone":"99999999", "latitude":-32.993535, "longitude":-71.177193, "far_gate":"LOCKED", "distance":8000.0, "geofence":"false", "radius":0.0}

	    {"os":"android"}
    ]
}

   Here you can see the user identified by his phone number, inside is his token and
   his gates. Also now theres info about the os of the device he is using, more info
   may be included in the future.
6. So we want to create your user, copy the form bellow so we dont make type mistakes.
7. Paste it at the end of the file. It's important that the data from the user before
   you ends with a ',', as seen in the example so the script gets that there's a new
   user.
8. Now you can replace your phone number an token. Then defining your gates by
   replacing the info of you gates in the old ones, be carefull in typing new data so
   it matches with the format(?); numbers dont go in " " except by the phone number of
   your gate.

IMPORTANT
9. The phone number of your gate it's an important point. If you're playing around with
   the application and want to add gates that wont actually open a real one, the phone
   number must be set to "99999999" (eight nines), this tells the script that the gate
   is not real in order not to call to the gate. In the other hand, if you are adding
   a gate that has a intro number and want to open it in the real world, enter the gate
   number in this space.
10. Another important parameter is the "far_gate". Intro checks if you are too far from
   from your gates so you dont make the mistake to open one that should've stayed closed.
   So what you do with the "far_gate" parameter is to decide wether the app alerts that
   you are trying to open a gate further than a 'distance' (also set by you), or to simply
   lock the gate so it can't be opened unless you enter the gate area again.

    10.1 "far_gate" takes one out of two posible values:
            - ALERT
            - LOCKED
         if another value is set, a warning sign appears in the app dont leting you open
         the gate
